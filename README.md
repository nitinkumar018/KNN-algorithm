# K-NEAREST NEIGHBOURS
## The objective of this assignment is to implement and evaluate the K-Nearest Neighbours algorithm for classification
## 1. Analyse the data using the visualizations
## 2. Preprocess the data by handling missing values & Outliers, if any.
## 3. Split the dataset into training and testing sets (80% training, 20% testing).
## 4. Implement the K-Nearest Neighbours algorithm using a machine learning library like scikit-learn On training dataset
## 5. Choose an appropriate distance metric and value for K.
## 6. Evaluate the classifier's performance on the testing set using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score metrics.
# Visualize the decision boundaries of the classifier.
